  This component is responsible for setting the global, regional settings required to allow API Gateway to write to
  CloudWatch logs.

  Every AWS region you want to deploy an API Gateway to must be configured with an IAM Role that gives API Gateway
  permissions to create and write to CloudWatch logs. Without this configuration, API Gateway will not be able to send
  logs to CloudWatch. This configuration is done once per region regardless of the number of API Gateways deployed in that
  region. This module creates an IAM role, assigns it the necessary permissions to write logs and sets it as the
  "CloudWatch log role ARN" in the API Gateway configuration.
